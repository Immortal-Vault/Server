# Immortal Vault - Server-Side

Welcome to the server-side repository for **Immortal Vault**, a secure password manager designed to safely store and manage your passwords. This repository contains the backend components and APIs that power the Immortal Vault application.

## üöß Project Status: In Development
The server-side components are currently under active development. We are working diligently to ensure a robust and secure backend for the Immortal Vault application.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Database Integration**: Interfaces with a PostgreSQL database to handle user data and configurations.

- **Localization Support**: Supports multiple languages to ensure a consistent experience with the client-side application.

## üåç Localization
The server-side supports localization to align with the client-side application. Ensure that your language preferences are synchronized across both the client and server.

## üí° Roadmap
- Implement additional API endpoints for new features.
- Enhance security measures and authentication processes.
